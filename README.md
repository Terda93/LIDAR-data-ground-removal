# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course: LIDAR data ground removal

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 
This project deals with working with LIDART data. Specifically in the form of .pcd files. 
It deals with finding the most suitable method for detecting and removing points representing the ground on a dataset taken with a drone in the forest.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

The motivation for this project is my own work with the given dataset and future work with these pre-prepared data. 
This method could be useful for other LIDAR datasets because it is quite general and copes with terrain roughness quite well.
